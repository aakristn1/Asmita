          <p>My Sweet Asmita,

            Asmu, my love, my everything. I sit here pouring my heart out onto this page, knowing that words alone might never fully capture the depth of what I feel for you. But I am going to try, because you deserve to know just how profoundly you have shaped my world, how every beat of my heart echoes your name. This letter is not just a collection of thoughts; it is a manifesto of my undying love, a plea from the soul of a man who realises too late how irreplaceable you are. I have built this website as a sanctuary for us, a digital space where our memories can live on forever (you cannot delete the photos of us from this website fortunately), and now I am adding this letter to it, like the final piece of a puzzle that only makes sense with you in it. I hope that it touches you the way you have touched me.
            
            Let me take you back to those early days, when our love was a wildfire, reckless and all-consuming. We were so madly in love, were we not? Doing the stupidest things together just because it felt right, sneaking off on spontaneous adventures, laughing until our sides hurt over nothing at all. Remember those random little dates? We would grab ice cream at midnight and wander through Granville park hand in hand, lost in our own little universe. We were obsessed with each other and could not get enough. I would drive across what felt to me at the time as half the world just to see your smile, and we would hang out talking until 3am, even when we both had work the next morning. The world could have been falling apart around us, but in those moments nothing else mattered. Your voice, your laugh, the way your eyes lit up when you would share some silly story (as long as it did not have a ‘they’ or ‘it’ in it because then I knew there was a guy involved😒). It was pure magic. And Asmu, I want to do everything in my power to make that happen again. To recapture that spark, to build it into something even stronger, because I know deep down we were made for this.
            
            But life threw us curveballs, did it not? After that trip to Korea, everything shifted. We went no contact, and those weeks felt like an eternity of silence, a void I could not fill. Then in November we started talking again, tentative at first, but it grew in December, like embers reigniting. Now here we are at the end of 2025, and you are ready to leave us behind, to start fresh and alone in 2026. I understand why; I have hurt you, and the pain I have caused is something I will carry forever. But Asmu, I am not ready to let go. Not when I know what we could be.
            
            You are my clan's co-leader, remember? The way you would strategise with me, always one step ahead, making everything better just by being there. And hopefully you can be a co-leader in my life again, guiding me, challenging me, loving me through it all. Those small things we shared haunt me in the best way. Like when you started working mid-this year and we talked about matching polo jumpers for our work fits. It was such a simple idea, but it symbolised everything, us as a team, coordinated, unstoppable. Or that paper pistol you made for me; it is still in my car, right there in the centre compartment, a tangible reminder of your creativity and the love you poured into even the littlest gestures. I look at it every day and smile through the ache.
            
            You know something, maybe once a week I wake up paralysed thinking we are still together and we made it work, because before the sun went down you were the best thing in my life. That dream lingers, pulling me back to reality with a crash, but it fuels me too. I am putting everything into this because I know this will be the only way I will ever be able to win back my girl. I just hope it is enough to pierce through the walls you have built around your heart. I get random dreams with you in them and get so angry when I have to wake up and realise it was all in my head, and I also get the worst gut-wrenching nightmares as well when you are in my dreams but not in the way I intended you to be in them. What I am trying to say is, even when I am asleep, when I should not be thinking about anything, you are there, bright as ever piercing through my head being the only thing I can think about even when I am not supposed to be thinking about anything.
            
            You are absolutely right in saying if we see each other again it will be awkward. I mean, for God's sake, we will probably go from arguing about having a boy or a girl to you wanting to name our daughter Sienna and me not wanting to, and discussing how you would like your favourite emerald-cut engagement ring to look to asking what your favourite colour is and where you are from. But that is okay with me. I will build everything from the ground up just to be with you, Asmita. I know you never really wanted to watch the film Sing, but there is a really good quote in there that says, “You know the thing about hitting rock bottom, there is only one way to go and that is up!” And I know we are at rock bottom right now, but I just know we have so much potential for the future of us.
            
            You gave me a chance to win you back and I did not take full advantage of it. Now it has come to a point where I am not even asking but begging you to give me another chance at loving you as much as is physically and mentally possible for a man. The reason I have not texted you asking for a second chance and to meet up consistently is because I know a text is not going to do anything. It is all just words at the end of the day, and I want to do something to show you what I am saying is not just words, that it is more than that.
            
            Although late, I told you things that I thought would have made you run away from me, but you did not, and I was still stupid enough to keep things from you. I wish I made these mistakes in a random throwaway relationship so I could have never done these to you, but even then that would mean I would not be with only you, and you are the only thing I want to be with. I can die peacefully knowing I tried for the love of my life.
            
            I know you are thinking that I am doing everything I have done right now to try and win you back. There is truth in that, but I am doing all this because these were the things I should have been doing when we were together. Truth is, what I am doing is so completely wrong. I should be letting you move on and go onto better things. But I want you to embrace the path less certain, the one that could lead us back to each other.
            
            I want every part of you and want to become the boyfriend you taught me how to be, without all of the issues from the past. You have invested so much into me, and I am not letting that go to waste. It is you forever, Asmita. It will always be you.
            
            I know what I am asking for is risky, but everything good in life comes by taking a risk. Take a risk on me again and let us start anew. We can run away and leave everything behind. No matter where we are, I know for a fact I will always be happy as long as you are there by my side.
            
            If we were ever to get back, I know a lot of people will have a lot of things to say, your friends, my friends. Hell, I am nervous about seeing your parents again, and we just started talking (you can tell I am delusional). But I do not care what anyone says; I just want to give you all the love, care and affection in the world, and whatever they have to say they can shove it up their ass.
            
            Truth is, when I said you did not want me seeing my friends, I was wrong. That was not the case. You just did not want me to be around druggies, and also I gave you trust issues, so you were valid to worry. I promise that is not the case any more.
            
            I know you said you will not love me again, but I genuinely believe that our love is so strong it can make miracles happen.
            
            I feel ashamed for doing this as well and bringing shame to your parents too. You introduced me to them and they (Mum mostly) accepted me with open arms, and I ruined it all by just not being able to be a normal freaking boyfriend.
            
            I was so stupid to only realise this when it is too late. I should have made you feel more prioritised than my friends. I am so sorry for that. I have received so much clarification in losing you that I know what I need to do and the changes to make, and I promise you I will never let you feel the way you did before ever again. I promise to prioritise you over everything else, put you on a pedestal, and make sure you always feel loved and happy around me and never ever shed a tear unless it is tears of happiness.
            
            Please give me a chance to treat you the way I should have from the beginning, to show you that I am a real man who wants nothing more than his beautiful picture-perfect wife by his side at all times.
            
            Truth is, yes, I am jealous seeing other people do things for you. I want to be the best for you.
            
            We are going to get into fights, we are going to argue, we are going to disagree and be upset with each other; that is a given. Every single relationship in the world will go through that. But I do not even care because I know we will bounce back from all of those things because of our love. I want to experience the world with you and every single thing it contains, the ups and the downs, and I want to be there when things get rough and we see the other side of the rainbow one day and think that we made it and laugh about all the arguments we once had. Right now is the downs part; we are in such a bad spot, and you feel as vulnerable as ever, and I broke your heart. I just want the chance to repair it piece by piece and love you as much as is humanly possible until I die. There is a great Japanese art of repairing I like called Kintsugi which translates to “join with gold”. I know once I put your heart back together it will not be perfect or where it was when we first met, there will be cracks in it, but I will fill it up with gold and fix it just like the Japanese art. I mean, your favourite thing in the world is gold right?
            
            I treated us like a chore, and I will never do that again ever.
            
            I do not want us to stop talking after New Year’s. I want to change every single part of me to be the man you deserved, and I will do whatever it takes.
            
            I know the love we had was real, and I will never give up on it. I will do anything it takes to be able to experience the love we once gave each other again. The difference this time being you love the real unfiltered raw flawed me, and I love the same old you who has always been perfect. I never will give up on us and will fight till I die for you, Asmita. Please give us a chance; let me give you what you deserve and what I should have given you from the start all those times ago. It is the least you deserve for putting up with me and my lies and my betrayal.
            
            I know you said we will never get back together, but I want to do everything I possibly can to change that. I have begged and cried to have you back and still hurt you. I want to treat you right and so well to the point where you yourself choose to want to be with me, and I genuinely will give anything for that. All I want is a life with you. I know your friends would say shit if they found out, and so would mine, hell I am scared the next time I would see your parents. That is how far I have planned ahead and how delusional I am about us. But fuck what anyone thinks; all I care about is what you think and your happiness, and I will give it my all to make you the happiest girl ever. The only tears you will shed will be happy tears.
            
            You gave me everything you had when I deserved none of it. I know it may be too late, but let me return everything you have done for me tenfold. That is how much I want to treat you right, and I will go so far to make it happen, Asmu. You deserve nothing but the best, and I will make sure I give it to you.
            
            Let me treat you the way I should have, the way you were meant to be treated. Let me take us back to the time where you wanted to be my wife and I wanted to be your husband. The only difference being you want me for the real me, not the me that hid behind lies. Let me do everything I can for you, Asmu. Come home, and if it is not with me yet then let me follow you everywhere you go because my home is not a place, it is a person, and it is you. Wherever you go I will follow because that is my home.
            
            I am obsessed with you in honestly an unhealthy way. Every hour of the day I am constantly thinking about you. You are the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing I think of when I sleep. I know there are guys that are handsomer, richer, cooler (not funnier though), and have a working left knee. But I promise you none of them will be as obsessed with you as I am. I will give you the best experiences I possibly can right now, and when I am rich I will spoil you like a princess.
            
            Let us take a leap of faith with us. Let us relive the best parts of our relationship every day without the bad stuff. I have learned so much from you on how to become a better person and a boyfriend, so let me give you all of it. No more distractions, no more bad influences, no more lies and no more hurting you. Just consistent happiness and love. Let me treat you right, Asmu. Let me love you endlessly and forever. Let me give you what I could not before.
            
            I do not want to ask you for anything; I do not want you to be forced into feeling a certain type of way about me. All I want is to treat you right and from there on see where it takes us. I want you to fall in love with me again because you cannot help it and it just happens. I want these things to happen naturally to you from the actions I take and things I do for you.
            
            This whole time the thing I had to fix was me. My negligence caused harm for our relationship, caused us to fight, to argue and to have constant disagreements. I always tell you how much I love you and I genuinely mean that and always will. The issue was I did not love myself. I did not love myself to be comfortable enough with my mistakes so I lied and I kept lying to you and hurting you. I was selfish and self-centred and neglected you as a result. How does one neglect his partner and think that it is okay? It really is not, and I think about it so much and how wrong I was for it all. I could say I love you all I want but how could I mean it and actually do the things that made you feel loved when I did not even love myself so I thought it was okay to not do it. The month away really gave me a lot of time to really reflect on us and I found so many issues within myself that caused this divide between us and our relationship, and I am so sorry for that. You were a way greater person for me and I was not even a better person for myself and I guess I fell behind and then you deserved better because of my inadequacy. I do not want that anymore; I want to be the best version of myself for us. You are worthy of so much love and although I said it I barely showed you it and I should have loved you so much more, so much more passionately and so much more aggressively and I am sorry I did not. I want to do everything I could not do and more for you if you give me a chance, if you give us a chance again. I know I am asking for a lot but I promise to love you endlessly and never let you down, Asmu. Oh yeah and to also cry at our wedding, but honestly that is going to be a given because I cry of sadness every time I think of us ending and never talking to each other so I cannot imagine the happy cry I will be having knowing you are officially my wife and partner forever.
            
            You know the reason I am so obsessed and in love with you is because most people look at someone in the eyes and it reminds them of someone but for me when I look into those big beautiful eyes of yours it does not remind me of anyone. Instead it reminds me of all the happiness, love and affection you bring. Everything is all just uniquely yours because you really are 1 in 8 billion sweetheart.
            
            Please give me another chance to be the man I should have been for you. I will do everything in my power to make you the happiest girl ever. Please let me be the man I could not be before. Our story is not over and never has to be; I do not ever want to close this chapter of our life story called ‘The amazing Aakrist and Asmita’.
            
            You are in a position where you have to take a lot of risk and it is going to be so hard for you but if this is any help all these rich millionaires were made by taking risks. I know I am not a millionaire yet but God I promise to make you feel like one every day of your life if you take this risk and let me come back into your life.
            
            Let me make everything right. Let me be your New Year's kiss again. I will not be able to be your 12am kiss so let me try to be your 12pm kiss. If that is not possible either let me just kiss you on the 1st day of 2026.
            
            I guess this is my grand gesture to try and win you back one last time. I was thinking of making a white house with blue curtains but let us be real in this economy it is basically impossible (for now) so I did the 2nd best thing I could use my skills for and built you This. This website is our digital notebook of love filled with memories, hopes and everything that screams how much you mean to me. Unlike a house, gifts, food and other physical things this will be forever here as good as it was on day 1. Bookmark this website because I am not done making it for you Asmu. I have so much I want to do with you and for you. Please do not let all of this end. I love you Asmita Ghimire Nepal.
            
            Forever yours, with all my love,  
            Aakrist N.
